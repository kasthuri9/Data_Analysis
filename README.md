Suggestion:
1. Cancellation rate rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservation, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations.
2. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers
3. The ratio of cancellation vs non cancellation is much higher in the resort hotel than the city hotel. Could counter this by doing special discount on the weekend.
4.  In the month of January, hotel should start marketing as the cancellation is the highest in this month
5.  They should also increase the quality and service in Portugal to help reduce the cancellation rate.
